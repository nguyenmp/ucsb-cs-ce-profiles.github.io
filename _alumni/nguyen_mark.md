My name is Mark Nguyen, and I graduated with a BS CS in 2015. I'm currently working for [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/watch/) where I create tooling and infrastructure for watch automation. My work has me thinking about how to scale instrumentation down to run quickly and reliably on embedded systems as well as how to scale out reporting, testing infrastructure, and monitoring across thousands of devices constantly spewing data.

While at UCSB, I competed in ICPC and presided over the local student chapter of ACM. I also spent two years working with Professors John and Janice Baldwin volunteering in the sociology department on [their education website](http://sexinfoonline.com). For a year and a half, I interned at Procore working on various parts of their android product, primarily focused on feature support and performance optimizations.

What was great about my time pursuing my degree in CS at UCSB CS was being surrounded by incredibly driven and smart people, both colleagues and professors, who were all very easy to get along with.
